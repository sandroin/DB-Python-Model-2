# DB-Python-Model-2
The aim of this Python script is to demonstrate the implementation of a many-to-many relationship between students and advisors in an SQLite database. It achieves this by creating three tables: Advisor, Student, and Relationships. The Advisor table stores information about advisors, the Student table stores information about students, and the Relationships table establishes many-to-many relationships between students and advisors. Sample data is inserted into these tables, and then a new table named Advisor_Student_Relationship is created by joining the Advisor, Relationships, and Student tables. This new table contains information about the relationship between advisors and students. Finally, the script executes a query to count the number of students advised by each advisor and prints the results.
